Caveat
------
   Due to a bug or an unexpected change in the storage structure of
   freebsd-update, this utility may render your system destroyed or
   unable to rollback later when needed.  Do not use this utility
   unless you are really running short of disk space and you are
   prepared to reinstall if something goes wrong.
